Polymorphism - a single function call / action that can take different forms
               based on the situation


rededefined function - use static binding - function call
                       is bound at compile time based on how the pointer it's
                       called on was declared
virtual function - function that uses dynamic/late binding
                   is bound at run time based on the type of object the pointer
                   points to at the time

virtual functions need to be set as virtual in the base class
They must be implemented OR be made as "pure virtual"

If a class has a pure virtual function, it is an "abstract class" and we
cannot instantiate objects of that class.

When your class has virtual functions - make the destructor virtual so that
when memory is freed for a base class pointer to a derived class object, all the
correct destructors will be called
